    "## In this notebook\n",
    "This notebook contains instructions for performing Retrieval Augumented Generation (RAG). RAG is an architectural pattern that can be used to augment the performance of language models by recalling factual information from a knowledge base, and adding that information to the model query. The most common approach in RAG is to create dense vector representations of the knowledge base in order to retrieve text chunks that are semantically similar to a given user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG use cases include:\n",
    "- Customer service: Answering questions about a product or service using facts from the product documentation.\n",
    "- Domain knowledge: Exploring a specialized domain (e.g., finance) using facts from papers or articles in the knowledge base.\n",
    "- News chat: Chatting about current events by calling up relevant recent news articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest form, RAG requires 3 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initial setup:\n",
    "  - Index knowledge-base passages for efficient retrieval. In this recipe, we take embeddings of the passages and store them in a vector database.\n",
    "- Upon each user query:\n",
    "  - Retrieve relevant passages from the database. In this recipe, we use an embedding of the query to retrieve semantically similar passages.\n",
    "  - Generate a response by feeding retrieved passage into a large language model, along with the user query."

People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.   \\n\\nWe’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person. \\n\\nOur schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. \\n\\nAnd with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely. \\n\\nWe achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. \\n\\nOf course, continuing this costs money. \\n\\nI will soon send Congress a request. \\n\\nThe vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.   \\n\\nFourth, we will continue vaccinating the world.     \\n\\nWe’ve sent 475 Million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation. \\n\\nAnd we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.')],\n",
